# iOS-portfolio

My name is Haley Parker and I am a senior student at Eden Prairie High School. I have taken AP Computer Science Principles, AP Java, iOS app development, and am currenty in advanced iOS app development. My goal throughout these classes has been to develop an understanding for different programming languages, and I am continuing this learning in advanced iOS this year. Below are short descriptions of the projects I have worked to help create. Each project also has a link to its readme file, where I talk more about the development process.

March 2022 - [EPHS Word Game](https://github.com/90306479/EPWordGuess) is an app that I have been working on with a partner for the past month. It is an app that resembles the popular word game "Wordle" but is designed to play across iMessage. It is the first high-level iMessage app I have worked to create, so much of my initial learning was focused on the iMessage framework. Afterwards, I worked to add more functionality and features to the app, and to distrivute it to be played by peers.

February 2022 - [Restaurant Lists](https://github.com/90306479/newRestaurants.git) is an app I worked on at the start of advanced iOS app development. The app can be used to review and rate restaurants in or near my city. I used an apple development tutorial as the app baseline then changed the focus of the app and added features which would make it more usable for my local community.

May 2021 - [Pocket Pantry](https://github.com/EPHS-iOS/GroceryTest.git) is the main iOS application I focused on during regular iOS development. I worked on this app with a classmate, but because of the covid situation at my school we were forced to collaborate strictly online. Much of my learning involved with creating this app was in learning how to effectively communicate digitally using online applications such as slack. This is also the first collaborative app I worked on so I learned how to push and pull code through GitHub. The app allows users to keep inventory of their pantry, store recipes, create grocery lists, and set a meal planning calendar. At the end of the semester, my partner and I had the opportunity to [present](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nVmY10nGP_ObAj1-P91eLsXleMsBEFvc_LefuGG2nTY/edit?usp=sharing) our learning and finished app with the class, as well as share what we would like the change/improve within the app.

January 2021 - [Blackjack](https://github.com/90306479/blackjack.git) is the first iOS game I buit from scratch using xcode. I was inspiried by a video tutorial by code with Chris that I followed which created the card game "war." I created my blackjack game from scratch, starting with the user interface then adding functionality. Creating my Blackjack game helped me become familiar with coding in swift and helped me be successful in future projects.
